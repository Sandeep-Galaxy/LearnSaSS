For Loops

For loops in Sass can be used to style numerous elements or assigning properties all at once. They work like any for-loop you've seen before.

Sass's for loop syntax is as follows:

@for $i from $begin through $end {
   //some rules and or conditions
}

In the example above:

    $i is just a variable for the index, or position of the element in the list
    $begin and $end are placeholders for the start and end points of the loop.
    The keywords through and to are interchangeable in Sass

For-loops are useful for many things, but in the following exercises we will be using them to style a block of rainbow divs!

$total: 10; //Number of .ray divs in our html
$step: 360deg / $total; //Used to compute the hue based on color-wheel


.ray {
  height: 30px;
}

//Add your for-loop here:
@for $i from 1 through $total{
  .ray:nth-child(#{$i}){
    //background: blue;
  	background: adjust-hue(blue, $i * $step);
  }
  
}
