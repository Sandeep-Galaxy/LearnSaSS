Arithmetic

The Sass arithmetic operations are:

    addition +
    subtraction -
    multiplication *
    division /, and
    modulo %.

Note: Modulo, or %, is the remainder in a given division, so "9%2" would be "1".

SCSS arithmetic requires that the units are compatible; for example, you can't multiply pixels by ems.

Also, just like in regular math, multiplying two units together results in squared units:10px * 10px = 100px * px.

Since there is no such thing as squared units in CSS, the above would throw an error. You would need to multiply 10px * 10 in order to obtain 100px.
